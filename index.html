        <h1>Still Figuring It Out</h1>
        <p>The goal might be to finish making the hangman review game that I wanted to make a few months back. We'll see if I get anywhere with that, lol.</p>
        <p>Gotta make sure I have the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User chooses a category.</li>
            <li>Add letters to the word/phrase when user chooses it.</li>
            <li>Add body parts when an incorrect letter is chosen.</li>
            <li>Reveal the answer at the end.</li>
            <li>User will have ability to guess the entire phrase.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
